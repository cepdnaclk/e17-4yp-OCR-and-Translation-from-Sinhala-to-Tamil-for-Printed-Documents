## Abstract
Sinhala and Tamil are the official national languages of Sri Lanka. But most people only speak or read one of them, making a language barrier. This research aims to create an accessible tool to translate Sinhala documents into Tamil language. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with the underlying technology of Tesseract is used to identify the characters from documents and using Google Translation API, translation is done. Pre-processing and post-processing techniques are used to improve the accuracy of the system.

## Conclusion
At the end of the research, we were able to develop a tool that is accessible to a diverse user base which enables the translation of Sinhala documents in different formats into editable Tamil texts thereby overcoming linguistic barriers. The system's optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy rate was 85%, and its translation accuracy rate was 77%. These were observed after utilizing pre-processing and post-processing techniques.

This tool may lead to further growth in future such as bringing out more reliability, accuracy and modification of the tool to support different other languages. As well as the research can be extended to overcome further related issues. A significant impact can be made in society through this as it allows people to get information and knowledge in their native language. It will interconnect the world and keep individuals informed and allied regardless of their linguistic aspects.
